# 🗺️ Yemen Geo-Demography Dashboard

This project visualizes Yemen’s population structure and demographic trends in an interactive way.  
It uses **Leaflet maps** and **Chart.js charts** to explore population changes between 2015 and 2030 at the district (ADM3) level.

The dashboard also includes an **AI-based policy insight** module that summarizes each region’s demographic trend — for example, aging population, youth expansion, or labor-age balance — and provides short policy suggestions accordingly.

## 🌍 What the Project Does

- Displays Yemen’s population by administrative region (ADM3)

- Automatically generates short policy insights based on population structure
